    <h1>Photography: My African Dwarf Frogs</h1>
    <p>I have a few pets. Three of them are rats (I'm not kidding, btw) and 4 of them are frogs. African Dwarf frogs, to be precise. They are tiny little aquatic frogs that live in a tank. About the size of a quarter, maybe a little bigger. But not huge. I have had them since 4th grade, and since then I have taken photos of them all the time. Some of the photos are lost in the endless expanse that is my parents' dropbox folder, but I pulled up some of the highlights and put them on my site. I know this is a deviation from the normal tech things I do, but I was sitting on these photos for years and wanted to share them. For anyone that is wondering, I shot it all on a Nikon Coolpix S33 camera. I mainly used the "shoot underwater" mode though I didn't actually put the camera underwater. Other than that, enjoy the pictures!</p>

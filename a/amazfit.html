<h1>Amazfit Band 5 Review</h1>
<p>So recently I got a new fitness tracker watch, the Amazfit Band 5. It was 40 dollars on amazon.com. And I think it was a pretty good deal! I
mean it's got step tracking, heart rate, SpO2, various workout modes, alexa integration, weather, and more. Plus there are like 30 different clock
faces on the app. So all in all it's pretty nice! But of course, it is a 40 dollar band, so it has a few disadvantages. Read on to see if this
could be your next watch! </p>

<p>So when I bought this thing my expectations were pretty low. Most cheap tech I buy comes from China with a really bad gui and some pretty
crappy software. So when I installed the app for this watch, the Zepp app, I was already impressed, since it felt high quality and smooth to use.
And once I got the band, pairing was <i>easy.</i> All I had to do was set the watch on the charger, turn on the app, press "pair new device,"
and it boom, it was paired. Took all of 10 minutes to get it up and running. I personally think the experience with the software and getting 
paired was easier than with a name brand fitbit I used to have.
</p>
<p>Now it comes to actual usage of this band. Step tracking seems really accurate, which was probably the feature I most wanted when I got this.
But other aspects seem to work well too like heart rate. There is even a feature to have a heart rate scan each minute, which is cool. It's
comfortable to wear, except my wrist is small, and I had to poke another hole in the band when I got it. That was an inconvenience. And they must
make those bands out of some super strong material, since it took several minutes with a drill to actually poke a hole. But that aside, there are
some other conveniences like Amazon Alexa, which for me works for about 30 minutes then I need to sign in again. So not really all that convenient.
Maybe that is just my luck though. And for people like me who like having different watch faces, this is for you. Seemingly endless options, from
practical ones to stylish ones. I currently have "Retro Wave" and also a photo face downloaded to my band.</p>
<p>So I definetly reccomend this product! I like it and I've had it for about a week and a half, so far so good! I'll leave an update on my site
if it breaks anytime soon, but smooth sailing for now!

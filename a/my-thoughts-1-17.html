<h1>My thoughts on Minecraft 1.17 </h1>
<p>1.17 was announced a little while ago and it is set to come out this summer. I am looking forward to this new update for a 
few reasons. I think the lush caves will make caving, something that has been in the game since the beginning, a more interesting
and varied experience. I think using come of those new massive caves to build survival bases will be pretty cool and I think people
could do some cool stuff with it. I don't know if I like the new wardens though, I think those could make caving too dangerous.
I think one thing that is nice about caving is how it's relaxing: there is the occasional mob and lava pit but it's not like there
is some dangerous boss down there.

<p>I do not like the new stalactites and stalagmites, though. I think those do NOT feel like vanilla minecraft and though I know people
    <i>always</i> say it feels modded after something is released, this one really does.

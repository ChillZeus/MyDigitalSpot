<h1>New Nintendo Game and Watch</h1>    
</center>
<p>Nintendo has a brand new console, but it really isn't all that new. In fact, it's based off of a console from 1980 called the Game and Watch, which was a low tech handheld console. Anyone remember <i>Game and Watch Ball?</i> You know, the game with the little robot-like creature that would juggle balls? Well, if you forgot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_%26_Watch">here</a> is the Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Of course, the 2020 game and watch is a little more capable than the original. It can run 3 games: the original 1985 Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros 2 (aka impossible edition), and a remake of Game and Watch Ball (yay).</p>

<p>Being able to run the original Mario games is a real seller for this console, because a lot of people want that nostalgia (and just a plain great game) in their pockets. After all, this console is just 67mm x 112mm x 12.5mm. Pocket sized! I will definetly be trying to get my hands on this console because I love the 1985 mario game so much and I would love to have it handheld.</p>
<p>Now for the price of this console: it's just $49.99 USD. Here it is at <a href="https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-game-38-watch-super-mario-bros/-/A-80893936#lnk=sametab">target.com</a> At the moment it is a little tricky to get your hands on, but I'm confident that stores will stock it before christmas, as there is a lot of demand for it right now. I know it's on my christmas list!</p>

<h1>Why you shouldn't buy the Mac Pro</h1>
</center>
<p>Apple has released their best Mac yet, the Mac Pro. And though the specs are pretty impressive, with up to 4.5Ghz processor, 42mb cache, 
    1.5 terabytes of RAM, and 3 gb/s write speed, you should not buy it for two reasons: it is extremely expensive and some parts are not up 
    to par with what you could build onto a pc. 
</p>
<p>The first reason is the Mac pro is EXPENSIVE. Very expensive. The base price is 5,999 dollars. If you were to max it out, it would set you
    back a whopping 53,000 DOLLARS! That is what you would pay for some Mercedes models! Now there is no doubt some people need a computer with
    insane specs. But why pay so much money for a mac when you could spend less and get a pretty comparable pc. I went to a PC building website
    and chose some of my specs. I got an intel core i9 processor with 20mb L3 cache, an nvidia rtx 3090 graphics card, 64GB of rgb RAM sticks,
    an Acer predator X34 1440p curved monitor, an MSI motherboard, two samsung 970 1TB SSDs (2.5 gigabytes per second write speed), a redragon 
    S101 gaming keyboard, and a redragon M612 gaming mouse. I’m not an expert on gaming PCs, but this has some decent specs. And guess how much
    this dream PC would’ve cost? UNDER 5,000 DOLLARS. Though some of the specs aren’t as high as the Apple Mac Pro, it is significantly cheaper
    and I could’ve gotten even better specs if I wanted. This was just a rough baseline I made to show how overpriced the pro is. Even 
    appleinsider.com, a website with some serious bias seems to think the Mac Pro is too expensive. Their website says, “So the total price, 
    including all the hardware but not the optional pre-loaded software like Final Cut Pro X, comes to $52,748. That's nearly nine times the 
    cost of the base unit. And excludes the Pro Display XDR or its stand.” It’s so ridiculous that this crazy expensive device doesn’t even 
    include a monitor! Guess how much that monitor costs? Base price of 5,000 DOLLARS! And don’t say you can’t get a PC because you don’t know
    how to build one: you don’t need to know how! You can pay a couple hundred extra to get it assembled with your part choice for you. In
    conclusion, the first reason why you shouldn’t buy a Mac Pro is it is extremely expensive.

<p>The second reason is that it doesn’t even have many advantages over a plain old windows gaming PC. It has a few different graphics card 
    options, all AMD, and compared to the NVIDIA 3090, or even a 2080, they’re really not all that great. userbenchmark.com says the RTX 3090
    is “hugely faster at multi rendering” and “hugely faster effective speed.” According to their lighting test, NVIDIA could get 304 FPS 
    and AMD Pro Vega II could get only 113. And of course if you’re after gaming, don’t get a Mac anyways, since most every game is designed
    for windows. Less than half of steam games are actually supported for OS X. Not to mention the Pro looks like a cheese grater. Like, I know
    this isn’t all that important, but still, it doesn’t look that good, and it would be nice if there was an rgb option (oh wait no I forget
    they’d probably charge an extra $2,000 dollars for it.) The only reason I think you would even think about getting this computer is if you
    needed 1.5 terabytes of RAM for something so incredibly demanding like extreme animation or something where OS X is actually useful. All in
    all, the second reason that you shouldn’t get the Mac Pro is because it doesn’t have many advantages over a cheaper windows gaming PC. 
</p>
<p>So in conclusion, you shouldn’t get an Mac pro for 2 reasons: it is ridiculously expensive and it’s not as good as the price tag would suggest.
    Instead of this, get a cheaper windows 10 gaming PC, and use the leftover money to buy two toyota corollas. Or a swimming pool. Or a Tesla.
    Or an RV. The choices are endless when you don’t pay 50,000 dollars for your computer! </p>

<h1>Raspberry Pi 400: First Impressions!</h1>
</center>

<p>It had been a couple days since I had last checked raspberry pi's website, a site I normally visit daily. Normally they have new projects posted there I like looking at. But when I loaded up the site this time, I saw something there I hadn't seen before. It was the Raspberry Pi 400, a new model that was just announced.</p>
<p>Let me start by describing the Pi 400. Pretty simple, actually. It looks like a keyboard. Yep, just a plain old keyboard. But if you look at the back you see USB-C, ethernet, Micro HDMI, GPIO pins and USB ports. The keyboard is, in fact, the computer. All the components are inside. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<p>Now let's talk specs. The new Pi has a quad-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, wireless networking, dual-display output, and 4K video playback, as well as a 40-pin GPIO header. The stats are fairly comprable to a Pi 4 (4gb RAM model, of course). The website states it "has specially designed thermals to keep your computer cool and silent while youâ€™re hard at work." Hopefully that means it won't run nearly as hot as some of the other Pi computers, because I know there have been times when I am running my 3 B+ and it will heat up to 80 degrees celcius without a fan running. </p>
<p>The Pi 400 complete kit will sell for $100 USD. That gives you the 400 itself, a USB-C power source, a micro hdmi to hdmi cable, an SD card preloaded with Raspberry Pi OS, a mouse, and the beginner's guide book. Pretty much everything you need to get up and running (minus a display, of course.)</p>
<p>I will probably not be buying one of these, though. I have my sights set on a plain old Pi 4 for my next computer. There's a couple reasons this model wouldn't work for me, mainly being I wouldn't get to use my sweet Redragon S101 gaming keyboard I bought for the sole purpose of using it on my Pi! Instead I would have to use the keyboard built into the 400, which reminds me too much of an Apple keyboard. Not cool, Raspberry Pi Foundation! I really hope they don't move away from the classic Pi board but I am intrigued by this new concept and think it could be cool!</p>

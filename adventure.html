<p>This game is in version 0.1.1. The story nor gameplay is finished, so don't expect an excellent experience yet. This game will continue to be updated but I'm also working on other projects, so there will probably be at most 1 update a week.</p>
<h3>Changelog</h3>
<p>v0.1.1 - Released 1-10-2021 - Added to story, created first option with three possible answers instead of two options.</p>
<p>v0.1.0 - First early access release - Story nor gameplay are finished, but added to site for early access.</p>

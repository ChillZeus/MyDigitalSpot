<h3>Sorry I haven't updated in a while, I've been working on some other projects!</h3>
<p>This game is in early access. The story nor gameplay is finished, so don't expect an excellent experience yet. This game will continue to be updated but I'm also working on other projects, so there will probably be at most 1 update a week. (Also: This game is not designed for mobile devices.)</p>
